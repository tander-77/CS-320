**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
    To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I focus on thorough testing and security best practices. Writing unit tests using JUnit helps me confirm that each part of my program works as expected before moving forward. I also use automated testing to catch bugs early and prevent issues from being introduced when making updates. When it comes to security, I make sure to follow best practices like input validation and proper authentication to protect against vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or unauthorized access. Regularly reviewing and updating my code also helps me maintain a high level of security and functionality. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
    Understanding user needs starts with gathering clear requirements before beginning development. This can include talking with (potential) users, reading project documentation, or analyzing similar programs to see what features are necessary. Breaking down requirements into user stories helps me design my program in a way that meets the end user's expectations. Throughout development, I test features to ensure they match the user's needs and make adjustments based on feedback. By focusing on usability and functionality, I can create software that is both practical and user-friendly.

**How do I approach designing software?**
    When designing software, I start by planning and outlining the structure before writing any code. I break down the project into smaller parts and decide how they will interact. Using object-oriented design principles helps me organize the program in a way that is modular and easy to maintain. I also consider scalability and efficiency, making sure the program can handle growth or additional features in the future. Once I have a clear plan, I begin writing code, testing as I go to ensure that everything functions correctly. This structures approach helps me build software that is well-organized, reliable, and easy to update.
